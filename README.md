# Blender pyBullet Simulation Importer

# TYLER DOCUMENTATION (September 9, 2024)

The purpose of this repository is to use Blender to create high-quality renderings of motions generated by PyBullet (or other simulators), particularly for robotics videos.

At a high-level, we need two things:

- **Recording code in your simulator to save motion data out to a file**
- **Blender plugin code to read in the file's motion data and import it into blender**

The motion data will require:
- The filepath to each visual mesh
- The pose of each visual mesh over time

The motion data is stored as a list of `Trajectory` objects. More information can be found in [custom_types.py](custom_types.py)

## How to Run

### Installing the Blender plugin

Make sure Blender is installed
```
sudo snap install blender --classic
```
Open up Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons` and click `[Install...]`.

Navigate to and import `pyBulletSimImporter.py`. Make sure the newly added `PyBulletSimImporter` add-on is enabled.

You should see an `Animation` tab to the right of the screen, where the UI for the importer is.

### Recording Motion Data

Example of recording motion data from a simple PyBullet simulation:

```
python generate_data.py
```

### Importing a pyBullet Simulation to Blender

In the `PyBulletSimImporter` panel of the `Animation` tab in Blender, click on `[Import simulation]`. Navigate to and select the simulation pickle file you want to import.

Notes:
 - If the simulation is large (i.e: many registered pyBullet objects, many 1000s of time steps,...), it might take Blender a while to import. Blender will freeze while it's importing. This is normal.
 - You can import multiple pickle files at once into Blender, and they will each be organized under their own Blender collection.

Also, there are additional parameters you can modify in the Blender plugin GUI, such as `skip_frames` and `max_frames`. Make sure to set these appropriately for your use case.

### Hand-tuning Blender Magic

After that, some things to do are:

- Set materials to the meshes (https://www.blenderkit.com/)
- Change the renderer to be higher quality
- Change the lighting to be more diffuse
- Set camera pose (or trajectory)

## Example Outputs

Below are some examples of the results (I'm still learning...). 

NOTE: Record the motion at a high frequency so that you don't have to interpolate in Blender. Blender does not implement [slerp](https://devtalk.blender.org/t/quaternion-interpolation/15883), so you can get bad interpolation of orientations.

# ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION

This Blender plugin + python script allows you to easily import pyBullet simulations into Blender for visualizations.

Tested on `Ubuntu 18.04.5` with `Blender 2.83.3`.

## Setup

### Installing the Blender plugin

Make sure Blender is installed
```
sudo snap install blender --classic
```
Open up Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons` and click `[Install...]`.

![](assets/installing-blender-plugin.png)

Navigate to and import `pyBulletSimImporter.py`. Make sure the newly added `PyBulletSimImporter` add-on is enabled.

## Usage

### Recording a pyBullet Simulation

`PyBulletRecorder` track poses of individual links in pyBullet simulations along with their mesh path (taken from the URDF file), then save the animation out into a pickle file. `PyBulletSimImporter` consumes these pickle files, import the corresponding meshes, then animate those links with pose keyframes.

To record a pyBullet simulation, checkout `demo.py`
```py
from pyBulletSimRecorder import PyBulletRecorder
import pybullet as p
import pybullet_data

# Setup pyBullet
p.connect(p.GUI)
p.setAdditionalSearchPath(pybullet_data.getDataPath())
p.setRealTimeSimulation(0)
p.setGravity(0, 0, -9.81)
p.loadURDF('plane.urdf')

recorder = PyBulletRecorder()
urdf_path = 'assets/power_drill/power_drill.urdf'
body_id = p.loadURDF(
    fileName=urdf_path,
    basePosition=(0, 0, 0.4),
    baseOrientation=(0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1))

# 1. Tell recorder to track a pybullet object
recorder.register_object(body_id, urdf_path)
for _ in range(500):
    p.stepSimulation()
    # 2. Take a snap shot of all registered link poses
    recorder.add_keyframe()
# 3. Dump simulation to a pickle file
recorder.save('demo.pkl')

```

### Importing a pyBullet Simulation to Blender

In the `PyBulletSimImporter` panel of the `Animation` tab in Blender, click on `[Import simulation]`. Navigate to and select the simulation pickle file you want to import.
